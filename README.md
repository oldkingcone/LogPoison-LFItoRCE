# LogPoison-LFItoRCE
this is a sort of handler that helps with log poison attacks. 


# How to use.

you will need to identify the injection point for the LFI, once you have identified that, when you do find the injection point, inject the one liner into the log and copy the URL. Once you start the client script, set the t_ip to the vulnerable URL and watch the magic happen.
